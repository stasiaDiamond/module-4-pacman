# Module 4 PacMan Assignment

## Description

An MITxPro Emeritus Codio homework assignment. A character that resembles PacMan will open and close its mouth as it travels across the screen. It is set to reverse direction once it hits the edges of the viewable screen.

## How to Run

Clone the repo, then launch with Live Browser from VS Code. Animation will auto start. Enjoy!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Perhaps add a second PacPal and have them sync up in some way
