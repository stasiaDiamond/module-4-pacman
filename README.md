# Module 4 PacMan Assignment

## Description

An MITxPro Emeritus Codio homework assignment. A character that resembles PacMan will open and close its mouth as it travels across the screen. It is set to reverse direction once it hits the edges of the viewable screen.

## How to Run

Clone the repo, then launch with Live Browser from VS Code. Animation will auto start. Enjoy!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Perhaps add a second PacPal and have them sync up in some way

## All That Documentation

Any comment prefaced by an asterisk (*) are notes I have added and not part of the curriculum

It helps me in the moment and also when coming back later to write detailed comments.

I'm adding some vocab here and taking this to the next level in this bootcamp so that I can attempt to make more sense of a whole lot of new information. This feels like journaling and making my own flashcards all in one. Very cool!

I'm glad I have the time and enough previous coding knowledge to break down each piece of this assignment.

Feel free to reach out if you spot something super incorrect. I want to learn and grow
