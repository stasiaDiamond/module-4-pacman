# Module 4 PacMan Assignment

## Description

An MITxPro Emeritus Codio homework assignment. A character that resembles PacMan will open and close its mouth as it travels across the screen. It is set to reverse direction once it hits the edges of the viewable screen.

## How to Run

Clone the repo. Launch with Live Browser from VS Code. Animation will auto start

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

* I already improved this by naming the images in such a way to better describe what the image was.

* I found that pacman1, pacman2, pacman3, and pacman4 did not describe what the pacman was doing, therefore it was difficult to remember which image was supposed to be placed where.

* I also created my own "PacPal" images in Canva so I didn't use the ones given by the curriculum.

* I don't plan on improving anything else.

## Truth Be Told

We were provided a lot of starter code here. But I was pleasantly surprised by the helpful comments given by the curriculum. This was the first time the comments within the code along with the Codio Guide have thoroughly detailed the assignment asked of us. What a surprising treat!

## Wins

I made my own Froggy PacPal in Canva. That was fun to create and add
